There is no commits because I first finished the code and then I realized I was supposed to make it before.

I defined 3 endpoints:
1) for current weather
2) forecast
3) forecast with added duration parameter

First one gives us information about current weather state (temperature and weather condition), second one how the weather will be in the next days and the third 
one how the weather will be in entered number of days.

How I was staring my code?
I did this project in js and did it in Visual Studio Code.
I opened Hyer from my folder, enter 'nodemon app.js' to start my file and in browser enter http://localhost:3000/weather/current?location=sarajevo for currrent
weather data, http://localhost:3000/weather/forecast?location=barcelona for forecast and http://localhost:3000/weather/forecast/London/3 for forecast with duration.
